This dataset simulates a pizza delivery business and is a hands-on exercise for
practicing SQL in a business intelligence context. The slides cover SQL problems
focused on real-world scenarios using JOINs, aggregations, window functions, and
subqueries.
The goal was to enhance my skills in:
Retrieving meaningful insights using various types of JOINs
Performing data transformations and aggregations
Ranking data with RANK()
Writing clean, optimized SQL queries
